# Eulm Files

A very basic private file hosting solution I made in a day to fix the limits enforced in chat applications.  
It has a 500MB upload limit (very easy to change) and a simple CLI tool to interact with the API.  
You can upload and delete files using the CLI and access uploads through a public URL.  
Better multi-user/permissions support and more administrative features coming soon.
